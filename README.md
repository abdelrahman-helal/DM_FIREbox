# Inferring Dark Matter Halo Mass in the FIREbox Simulation with Graph Neural Networks

## üéì Capstone Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for my capstone project on **"Inferring Dark Matter Halo Mass in the FIREbox Simulation with Graph Neural Networks"**.

## üìñ About the Project

This project explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict dark matter halo masses using data from the FIREbox cosmological simulation. By treating halos as nodes in a graph and connecting them based on spatial proximity, we can leverage the relational structure of the cosmic web to improve mass predictions.

## üî¨ FIREbox Simulation

The FIREbox simulation is a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation developed by the **FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments) collaboration**. It simulates galaxies at high dynamic range in a cosmological volume, providing detailed insights into galaxy formation and evolution.
